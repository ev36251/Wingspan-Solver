# Wingspan Model Improvement Plan (9 Steps)

1. Expand strict/manual power coverage for high-frequency non-strict birds in training/replay paths. (Completed: first batch)
2. Add deterministic golden replay tests for known reference games (including 127-point Oceania line). (Completed)
3. Add CI gate for minimum strict-certified bird count to prevent coverage regressions. (Completed)
4. Add round-order conformance tests (end-of-round powers, then goals, then cleanup) for both boards. (Completed)
5. Add score-breakdown parity tests (bird, bonus, round goals, eggs, cache, tuck, nectar) against fixed fixtures. (Completed)
6. Add standardized round-1 and full-game KPI benchmark jobs and artifact outputs. (Completed)
7. Retrain only on strict-rules datasets and remove legacy non-strict training path from default pipeline. (Completed)
8. Add candidate-vs-baseline model promotion gate using strict KPI compare. (Completed)
9. Retire legacy model artifacts/codepaths after strict model surpasses baseline and passes replay parity suite. (Completed)
